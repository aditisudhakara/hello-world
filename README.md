# hello-world
getting started

Hi Everyone!
Aditi here, I am a Software Engineer with 2 years of experience in Tech Mahindra (as of August 2016). I have spent the last 2 years developing my skills on Java, Perl scripting and UNIX shell scripting as they were used in the modules I was working on. Apart from this, I love reading, dancing and listening to music. Currently I am working on improving my existing skills and learning new things.
